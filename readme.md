**Modmail Discord Bot**

This Discord bot is designed to handle modmail messages within a server. It allows users to send private messages to the moderation team and creates a dedicated channel for each modmail conversation. Here are the key features:

- When a user sends a modmail message using the `!modmail` command, the bot checks for an existing modmail channel. If no channel is found, it creates a new channel under a designated category called "Mod Mail".
- The bot sends the modmail message to the dedicated channel along with the name of the user who sent the message.
- Moderators can reply to the modmail using the regular Discord chat interface. The replies are sent back to the modmail channel.
- To close a modmail conversation, moderators can use the `!close` command. This will delete the channel associated with that conversation.

To use this bot, you need to replace "YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN" with your actual Discord bot token. Make sure to invite the bot to your server and provide the necessary permissions.

Please note that this bot assumes you have the required Discord.py library installed and set up in your development environment.

Enjoy managing modmail efficiently with this Discord bot!
